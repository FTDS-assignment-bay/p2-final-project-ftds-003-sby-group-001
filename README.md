# TRAVELIND - Travel Plan Recommendation System
## Project Backgrounds
Tourism is one of the major sources of income for our country. However, its potential has not been fully utilized properly. Therefore, we are here to promote tourist attractions in Indonesia to more people. That way, we can drive the local economy and attract tourists from both within and outside the country. Here, you can get recommendations for tourist attractions based on your preferences as well as choose the tour packages offered.
